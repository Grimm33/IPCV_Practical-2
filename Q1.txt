a - Why are binary images smaller than grayscale images?

Binary images only contain 1 colour matrix, while colour images contain 3, one each for Red, Green, Blue

b - Why are the Pewter and Graphene colours the only ones visible?

Binary images are created through a thresholding algorithm, where greyscale pixels under a certain value will be white, while pixels over that threshold will be black.
This means that Pewter and Graphine are colours that are above that thresholding limit, so they were turned black

c - The above image required manual thresholding to achieve the above output.  What is adaptive thresholding and why do you think it is not suitable to render the above output?
